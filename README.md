In this GIthub you will see my files involed in making the smile school webpage. 

## Goals with this project
-  To understand what CSS is
-  What Search Engine Optimaztion or (SEO) is 
- What is HTML
- How to create an HTML page from a wireframe
- What is a markup language
- What is the DOM
- What is an element / tag
- What is an attribute
Another reason for this project is to go through the process of being given information that i will need to interpret and create a webpage based off of the information,
just like in the workforce.
